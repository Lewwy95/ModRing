## About

ModRing provides the automation of installing and uninstalling quality of life mods to Elden Ring.

## Requirement(s)

* Elden Ring (Steam)

## Installation

Run the 'ModGate.bat' file. This will check for mod installation and install them if required.

You can add this file to Steam by right clicking the Elden Ring game executable and creating a shortcut.

Add the shortcut to Steam then right click it and create another shortcut.

The latest shortcut can be added to Steam and then right click it in your library and go into its properties.

Under "Target" paste the following (change the initial path depending on where your game is installed):

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\ModRing\ModRing.bat"
```

Under "Start In" paste the following (change the initial path depending on where your game is installed):

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ELDEN RING\Game\ModRing"
